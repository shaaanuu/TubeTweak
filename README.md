**TubeTweak** is a YouTube downloader reimagined for efficiency and flexibility. Instead of downloading videos directly to your device, TubeTweak uploads them to the cloud, enabling you to tweak them—cut, trim, or edit—before downloading. This saves time and mobile data, ensuring you get exactly what you need!

## 🔧 Features:

- ☁️ **Cloud Upload**: Upload videos directly to the cloud for editing.
- ✂️ **Video Manipulation**: Cut, trim, and edit videos effortlessly.
- 📉 **Data-Saving Downloads**: Only download the final, edited version.
- ⚡ **Fast Processing**: Streamlined workflow for quick results.
- 🌍 **Cross-Platform**: Works across platforms for universal access.

## 🚀 How It Works:

1. **Upload**: Paste a YouTube link and upload the video to the cloud.
2. **Tweak**: Edit the video by cutting, trimming, or customizing it.
3. **Download**: Grab the finalized version directly to your device. Simple!
